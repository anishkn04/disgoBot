**This CLI application**, fetches data from publicly available website or a file in the same directory. It regularly checks for new events and posts updates when they are available. These updates are posted on both Discord and Facebook. The bot ensures that community members are always informed about the latest events. It streamlines event notifications across multiple platforms.

**The first initialization** will ask you to provide `pageId`, `botToken`, `page_access_token`, and `channel_id`.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run your bot on both Discord and Facebook platforms. If you have any specific code issues or need further guidance, feel free to ask!

Additionally, ensure that the events on the website are formatted as follows for fetching:

```json
{
    "events": [
        {
            "banner": "",
            "title": "",
            "start_date": "",
            "end_date": "",
            "location": "",
            "description": "",
            "link": ""
        },
        {
            ...
        },
    ]
}
```
If you do not want to host the events.json, just create a .json file in same directory and provide that during initial setup.
